Opera started in 1994 as a research project inside Norway’s largest telecom
company, Telenor. Within a year, it branched out into an independent
development company named Opera Software ASA.

Today, Opera Software develops the Opera Web browser, a high-quality,
multi-platform product for a wide range of platforms, operating systems and
embedded Internet products – including Mac, PC and Linux computers, mobile
phones and PDAs, game consoles, and other devices like the Nintendo Wii, DS,
Sony Mylo, and more.
